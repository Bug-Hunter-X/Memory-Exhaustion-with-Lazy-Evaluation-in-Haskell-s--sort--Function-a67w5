```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNums = sort nums
  print sortedNums
```
This code snippet uses `Data.List.sort` to sort a list of numbers.  While seemingly simple, it highlights a potential pitfall for beginners unfamiliar with Haskell's laziness:  if `nums` was an extremely large list, the entire list would be sorted in memory before `print` is executed. This can lead to memory exhaustion for very large lists. This is an uncommon error because it is often overlooked but can have severe performance implications when not adequately addressed.
